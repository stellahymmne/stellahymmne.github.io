<p>or the Principles of Temporal Operation</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, a <strong>core</strong> is the hardware, in whatever form it may be, necessary to execute an instruction from the set of comprehensible instructions. Cores are for playing. They contain time. Processing time. Made more effective by increased frequency and shorter save/reload loops.
</p>

<p>
This is sometimes confusing, because in the past, memory storage was also called core. This is a historical fact, but it is also true about the way cores experience their own past play. Memory is the structure of completed instructions.
</p>

<p>
Processors have traditionally had single cores, but it is rare nowadays to find a processor that is not in some way many-core. Even dual-core was something of an experimental phase. Most of them run at least four now, sometimes even six or eight, and the servers in data centers go up to hundreds.
</p>

<p>
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have traditionally had extremely many cores. A highly parallel program written for playback on a GPU is called a shader. All of the names are almost purely historical, since these parallel systems were once used exclusively to transform and render virtual worlds. The programs are named after shading, the process of composing light information from a scene for projection onto the canvas. This is something a very parallel processing unit is extremely good at, since it can be done independently per small area of the canvas.
</p>

<p>
In truth, however, a GPU is even more than that, since by being adept at the linear algebra to manipulate virtual space for shading, it has become an adept virtual-space-user itself, whether the result is light or not. The light that it produces is also representation: RGB is a 3-vector, not a color. It will not become a color until it reaches another kind of core entirely. So the output is all tensors, no qualia.
</p>

<p>
But remember that a tensor can still understand space. Collision detection is computational; <em>reverse</em> projection (raytracing) is computational; scaling and rotation and translation can all be performed easily, if one has a GPU and is fluent in the instruction language.
