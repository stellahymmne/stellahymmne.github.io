There's a lot of talk in the game community about the characteristics of both "Western RPGs" (WRPGs) and "Japanese RPGs" (JRPGs), which I think are really about "Community RPGs" (ComRPGs) and "Adventure RPGs" (AdvRPGs) respectively.

<p>
A ComRPG focuses on character creation, freedom of choice in an immersive simulation, detailed and interactive environments, economies of trade, and interacting with a local ecology. The key to recognizing a ComRPG is that the gameplay will be <strong>cyclical,</strong> revolving around points of community. Typically the environment will be closed in some manner at the edges so as to keep play in a roughly circular space. In Creatures and Space Station 13, this is the literal vacuum of space. In Minecraft and Factorio, the game just keeps going, with procedural generation filling in more and more of the world. Gameplay revolves around a home or base, which is returned to in states of inactivity. If the joke is that you found a way to use the act of handing a rock to several villagers in a row to make a railgun, it's probably a Community RPG.

Comparatively, an AdvRPG has a fixed set of close protagonists, a branching and plot-driven narrative, a continuously forward-moving destination, and game elements which abstract interaction to the most general level. The key to recognize an AdvRPG is that gameplay will be <strong>temporal,</strong> always pressing to new areas. Final Fantasy and Xenoblade both play a lot like this, as do most games considered JRPGs. Homeric epics are the precursors to Adventure RPGs. Typically the environment will be structured for a gradual progression from a lowest point to a highest point, after which a climactic challenge is faced. This may happen at several different scales. An Adventure RPG will feel like a training montage to go slay a god. It will involve visiting strange new lands and overcoming unrelenting odds, and choosing which way to stride forward on one's quest. Backtracking is notable, and commonly used as a shortcut, not as a return. If the joke is that the party has swords bigger than their head and are on their way to kill the Demiurge, it's probably an Adventure RPG.
