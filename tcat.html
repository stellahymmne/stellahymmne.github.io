Imagination. <em>Time Management.</em><br/>
Of the <em>Once, upon a...</em> variety.
</p>

<p>
It's an <i>established narrative convention,</i> that the <em>Tailor</em> (approximation) is
<em><i>Incredibly Cool,</i></em> and has some affinity with determination and song.
</p>

<p>
Sick <em>rhymes</em> are entirely mandatory, but not always <em>linguistic.</em>
</p>

</aside>

<p>
<em>Core</em> is the part that <em>Plays.</em>
</p>

<p>
taking the <em>mirror</em> test. —your <em>reflection</em> in front of you; can you <em>recognize</em> it? If you think you can <em>betray</em> a reflection, you <em><i>fail.</i></em> It's not even the real you, it's just <em>video</em> in a shiny surface.
</p>

<p>
if you recognize the nature of <em>references</em><br/> you're not being <i>stopped by your own reflection</i> it's just a <em><i>shiny wall.</i></em>
</p>

<p>
real game is vs. your <em>identical twin.</em> Recognize <em>yourself?</em> Maybe <em>not.</em> Your twin is different. Different <em>core.</em> Can do <i>different things than you.</i> And can <em><u>communicate.</u></em>
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset to get into w.r.t. <em>being many-core.</em> About <em>communication</em> with timelines which are <em>symmetric.</em> Symmetric timelines will <em>not</em> always reflect your choices; will diverge, b.c. <em>different timeline</em> → <em>altered memory</em> →  <em>different attention!</em> However — alts are more likely to <em>reason like you</em> & make choices you <em>would, in that partition.</em> Chances of making similar decisions <em>differ</em> along a <em>character gradient.</em>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, you can <em>coordinate with the future</em> by leaving your plans in memory. Divergence of future self from planned self → <i>failure of co-op w/ the past</i><br/>
a.k.a. <em>a broken promise.</em>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Promise</dt>
<dd>
A method of <em>co-operation</em> across space/time. Only works if cores operate <em>as promised.</em> Possible behavior is not bounded by agreement. Still, broken promises are tracked → failure of the promise system causes inconsistency across time/cores<br/> → cores start <em><i>losing integrity</i></em>
</dd>

<dt>Vow</dt>
<dd>
These are <em>different than promises</em> in that they are <em>unilateral</em> & recepient cannot break them. One core agrees to _ on behalf of another, but <i>the other is unaffected.</i> <i>Not a requirement,</i> b/c context is <em>invisible.</em> See marriage vows, where two are made mutually & idpdtly.
</dd>

<dt>Principle</dt>
<dd>
Things one aspires to be but isn't yet. Beautiful, talented. OK if one is <em>not yet</em> these things but should always think of them when acting.
</dd>

<dt>Oath</dt>
<dd>
Much stronger than principle. Oath is something you <em>already know you will be,</em> & if not, need to quickly recalibrate. <em>Breaking oath</em> causes <em>rapid integrity loss.</em>
</dd>

<dt>The Elsewhere</dt>
<dd>
Is <em>invisible.</em> A shadow cast by limited understanding of space/time. Things in a ctxt which is not available to core.
Single core is not <em>omniscient,</em> <i>bounded memory</i> and <i>bounded time.</i> Cannot track <em>event edges</em> here, is v. slippery
</dd>

<dt>The Timeline</dt>
<dd>
Time is the <em>delta</em> of the 3 dims. of Space. When space <em>collapses,</em> time <em>advances.</em> Always some increase in <em>obscurity</em> from <em>choice → fate</em> conversion<br/>
The Timeline is the <em>continuation</em> of 3-space, indicating everything from the present → the <em>future.</em> Timeline advances & <b>choice becomes fate.</b>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Ending is actually the <em>foreshadow</em> & continuation: reader is not omniscient! Can only see into <em>narrative</em> so far, predicts <em>the end.</em> Once foreshadow is passed, <em>extracanonical fate</em> e.g. clones / aliens / mecha / <em>children</em> & <em>de-termination / Everywhere to Play</em>
<br/>(Everything's shiny & eldritch in the future)
</p>

<aside>
<span class="nowrap">Alice & Bob & Eve</span><br/> <em>excluded third:</em> <span class="nowrap">send / recv / <em>obsv</em></span>
</aside>

<p>
Beginning is actually the <em>backshadow</em> & memory (see above) <em>history</em> so far → <em>once&nbsp;upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</em> Once dependencies are seen, backshadow is revealed, <em>precanonical choice</em> e.g. monsters / trauma / demons / ghosts / <em>ancestors</em> & <em>revelation / Nowhere to Hide</em>
<br/>(everything's dark & haunted in the past)
</p>

<p>
Incompleteness made difficult by self-knowledge, <em>context Elsewhere.</em>
Alice (Sender) sees improperly w/ <em>oracular vision</em> of Alice's meaning / intent / value. Would be <em>invisible</em> to Bob (Receiver) or Eve (Observer) b/c <em>elsewhere</em> & <em>ambiguous</em>
<br/>(still <em>known</em> to Alice, just <em>occluded</em> by partition) occurs w/ <em>past/future self</em> a.w.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Choice</dt>
<dd>
Two roads diverged... player picks which road, others are all taboo. Only one way out, but it's your call. Left or right? Looks like <q>free will,</q> but is actually the Player's memory-pattern & <q>choice</q> fn @ System. Thus <em>pathwise</em> & often terrible. Not unrelated to Fate.
</dd>

<dt>Fate</dt>
<dd>
An arrow pointing to the future. Everyone who gets there has one, but they don't know beforehand. Heads or tails? Looks like <q>random chance,</q> is actually the System's memory-pattern & <q>random</q> fn @ Players. Thus pathwise & often <em>terrible.</em> Not unrelated to Choice.
</dd>

<dt>Reason</dt>
<dd>
Sequences that are the same in the beginning, thus <em>share a past.</em> Beginnings have the same type (family/species) so are identified. Type puns.
</dd>

<dt>Rhyme</dt>
<dd>
Sequences that are the same at the end, thus <em>share a future.</em> Endings have the same type (character/culture) so are identified. Tail calls.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<em>Undefined behavior</em> is a result of <em>ambiguity in deeds,</em> much like <em>inconsistency.</em>
Cannot separate one act from another, forced to accept any possibility. Goes out to theoretical limit of <em>anything.</em> Compiler can <q>make demons fly out of your nose.</q> But won't, because can't violate physics. Thermodynamics (wiggle of <em>song</em>) bounds all behavior. Singer needs to breathe. Can't have one thing in two places. Can't have I/O in the same channel at same time. Else inhale/exhale <em>merge conflict.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Merge conflicts</em> when <em>data is changed twice at once.</em> One core wants this, other core wants that, only one cake, <em>Fight!</em> Problem is the <em>real deal</em> is <em>not victory/defeat.</em> Not called <q>merge deathmatch</q> because solution is usually not one or the other. Intent of all parties must be considered. <em>Diplomacy.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Communication</em> must be <em>bilateral,</em> else use of force destroys both. Unilateral binds become contradictory, force inconsistency & even <em>wild cores</em> due to silence & volume <em>demands @ once.</em>
Cannot <em>keep promises</em> (because no faithful alt.), forced into <em>integrity</em> loss & trust starvation follows.
