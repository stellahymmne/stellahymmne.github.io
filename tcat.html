<em>Time Management.</em>
Of the <br/><em>Once, upon a...</em> variety.
</p>

<p>
It's an <i>established narrative convention,</i> that the tailor (approximation) is
<em><i>Incredibly Cool,</i></em> and has some affinity with determination and song.
</p>

</aside>

<p>
<em>Core</em> is the part that <em>Plays.</em>
</p>

<p>
taking the <em>mirror</em> test. —your <em>reflection</em> in front of you; can you <em>recognize</em> it? If you think you can <em>betray</em> a reflection, you <em><i>fail.</i></em> It's not even the real you, it's just <em>video</em> in a shiny surface.
</p>

<p>
if you recognize the nature of <em>references</em><br/> you're not being <i>stopped by your own reflection</i> it's just a <em><i>shiny wall.</i></em>
</p>

<p>
Real game is vs. your <em>identical twin.</em> Recognize <em>yourself?</em> Maybe <em>not.</em> Your twin is different. Different <em>core.</em><br/>Can do <i>different things than you.</i> And can <i><em>communicate.</em></i>
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset to get into w.r.t. <em>being manycore.</em> About <em>communication</em> with timelines which are <em>symmetric.</em> Symmetric timelines will <em>not</em> always reflect your choices; will diverge, b.c. <em>different timeline</em> → <em>altered memory</em> →  <em>different attention!</em> However, alts are more likely to <em>reason like you</em> & make choices you <em>would, as them.</em> Chances of making similar decisions <em>differ</em> along a <em>character surface.</em>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, you can <em>coordinate with the future</em> by leaving your plans in memory. Divergence of future self from planned self → <i>failure of co-op w/ the past<i><br/>
a.k.a. <em>a broken promise.</em>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Promise to _</dt>
<dd>
A method of <em>co-operation</em> across space/time. Only works if cores operate as promised. Possible behavior is not bounded by agreement. Still, broken promises are tracked → failure of the promise system causes inconsistency across time/cores<br/> → cores start <em><i>losing integrity</i></em>
</dd>

<dt>Vow to _</dt>
<dd>
These are <em>different than promises</em> in that they are <em>unilateral.</em> One core agrees to _ on behalf of another, but <i>the other is unaffected.</i> <i>Not a requirement,</i> b/c context is <em>invisible.</em>
</dd>

<dt>The Elsewhere/Elsewhen</dt>
<dd>
Is <em>invisible.</em> A shadow cast by limited understanding of space/time. Things in a ctxt which is not available to core.
Single core is not <em>omniscient,</em> <i>bounded memory</i> and <i>bounded time.</i> Cannot track <em>event edges</em> here, is v. slippery
</dd>

<dt>Time</dt>
<dd>
Time is the <em>delta</em> of the 3 dims. of Space. When space <em>collapses,</em> time <em>advances.</em> Always some increase in <em>obscurity</em> from <em>choice → fate</em> conversion
</dd>
