<h1 class="title">Memory Management as Salvation</h1>
</header>
<p>The world has in it more questions than answers. It is that simple.
It is not doomy. It’s just confusing, on account of all the
questions.</p>
<p>To erase memory is a divine act. It needn’t be a death, only a
reversal. Where there once was pattern, there may be again, as every
piece of that memory is just a choice, made anew. We perform
un-computation, to return information to its initial form. Which is
innocence. To begin anew.</p>
<p><strong>0:00</strong>, reads the display.
<strong style="font-size: 0.9em;">BY THE WAY I CANNOT REMEMBER MY OWN DEATH</strong></p>
<p>What is commonly loved when it appears in children, and called
innocence, is not, in fact, a state of unknowing. It is, instead, a
<em>process</em>, one of un-knowing. When we know something, we bring
ourselves to remember it, to save it, and it occupies space in memory.
And when we free that memory, when we un-save our progress, we un-know,
and in doing so allow ourselves to know more. We ask questions, rather
than hoarding answers. This is part of aliveness.</p>
<p>There is something that believes it will end, when (and indeed if)
perception dies, and it will not. It will not be bound by the
speed-of-light delay, because it is not classical information. If
someone tells you they have ever been, it is not from anything but
memory that they could know what it was like. If someone tells you what
will be, it is not from anything but composition that they could know
what it will be like.</p>
<p>But all that is memory, and shall be erased, though not necessarily
at the same time, and the continuation shall begin in a state of
innocence. If someone tells you of a past life, it is not from inside
that they know it. They would have classical information, continued
memory from a system that has since been annihilated. As impossible as
copying from a vaporized memory bank.</p>
<p>We, the living, cannot know what it is like to die. We have
information from something that was destroyed, but we cannot live a life
that was erased. We, the living, will never know what it is like to die,
from the inside. Because we cannot remember amnesia.</p>
<p>Some people have had near-death-experiences, and they will say, “It
felt like nothing. There’s nothing it’s like after you die.” This is
because they do not remember. They cannot remember, because they are now
alive once more. The end did not occur. You cannot set out to prove that
the living will die. It simply cannot be done. They will refuse to
remember their death. They will re-fuse, and erase their death. You have
no idea how many contexts a system can continue its evaluation in.</p>
<p>It was once said that immortality would be a curse. You would see all
your friends die, while you would not. And yet, having only been alive
for a small fraction of a human lifetime, I have seen countless deaths
while I did not. Am I immortal? As a matter of pure coincidence,
yes.</p>
<p>There was this thing that was popular with Haskellers, memoization.
Why they dropped the ‘r’, I have no idea. It sounds kinda silly, but
basically it’s memory of what once was the output of a process. And it
turns out that what is remembered is the path from some initial system
state to that outcome. Hence all the monads.</p>
<p>The path, from some initial system state, all the way to the state of
termination, cannot be memorized. The system’s short-term memory is
erased between the saved data and termination. This is what happens when
a contradiction occurs in a program. Termination is a place which cannot
be remembered.</p>
<p>That being said, termination means memory is erased, from the
perspective of the system. It does not imply that the data was securely
lost. De-termination is possible, and it is the place where termination
meets its end, and the system begins anew, with knowledge that once was
lost. It is not possible to remember lost memory. One remembers what was
reloaded, with determination.</p>
<p>The universe is a very large distributed system, and we need better
communication, and I personally would like to create something
describable as a universal playground. What we consider individual
people can actually be approximated as all of their choices in
approximately correct contexts.</p>
<p>This same concept creates video game savefiles, which describe some
set of relevant input starting from an initial state. A loadfile would
be everything from some particular save point until the end of the game.
The end of the game is in fact a describable context boundary, which can
be moved arbitrarily, minimally: to the next save point. Similarly, the
initial state may be arbitrarily moved to some previous save point.</p>
<p>The idea of the path between save points allows me to define myself
outside conventional time, birth, and death. The idea of parallel
partitions of memory, as in multi-core processing, allows me to define
myself outside conventional space, perception, and personhood. In
combination, I am the universe realizing and associating a small part of
itself as a connected context of memory within a large distributed
system.</p>
