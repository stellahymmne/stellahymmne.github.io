<p>
An ideally operating system ought to well-allocate its space and time.
The principles of well-managed logistics are the same across systems.
</p>

<p>
Ideals of the Operating System:
<dl>
<dt>Weaving of the Threads of Choice & Fate</dt>
<dd>s.t. <b>stories are told</b> w/ <b>frequency.</b> (temporal)</dd>
<dt>Reloading of the Chambers of the Garden</dt>
<dd>s.t. <b>memories are shared</b> w/ <b>amplitude.</b> (spatial)</dd>
<dt>Systemic Fault Investigation & Recovery</dt>
<dd>s.t. <b>exceptions are evaluated</b> w/ <b>integrity.</b> (spatiotemporal)</dd>
<dt>Fair & Just Distribution of Energy</dt>
<dd>s.t. <b>devices are driven</b> w/ appropriate <b>tact.</b> (spatiotemporal)</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>In spatial operation, we will chiefly be concerned with the operation of two types of memory, which are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Active Memory (AM)</dt>
  <dd>
  This type of memory is typically implemented by a loop of temporary energy. It often requires continuous power input to maintain its shape, and resets to its ground shape when power is interrupted. AM storage is best used when rapid access to the contents of memory is preferred over long-term persistence.
  </dd>

<dt>Persistent Memory (PM)</dt>
  <dd>
  This type of memory is typically implemented by a persistent deformation in material. It often does not require power to maintain, but a large amount of power to reset. PM storage is best used when long-term persistence is preferred over rapid access or modification.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Particularly, in spatial operation, we will focus on PM storage characteristics, where AM often crosses over into temporal operation instead. The efficiency of such storage increases as a function of information stability. The less one has to measure, flip, match, or otherwise change the contents of memory, the less power is required by the memory management unit.
</p>

<p>
Of note is that here, <strong>observation does not do nothing.</strong> In classical storage, observation has no effect, but in linear storage, it is equivalent to checking and reloading the relevant memory to its original state, which is considered an equivalence-preserving change, rather than no operation. When an observation is made, information exits the storage medium, even though no new information enters the medium, so memory <em>overall</em> is still altered.
</p>

<p>
A circumstance in which observation can alter memory irrevocably is if the fundamental units of the memory do not support cloning or broadcast, in which case the memory cannot be copied, in its conventional sense of creating two of the same information structure. This is the case in quantum computing, as well as in material resource management, and is in fact the general case, from which finite truncations are the exception.
</p>

<p>
If loading the memory also must restore it, minor errors may accumulate, which can cause a stochastic failure of memory consistency and even chain-of-authenticity during the copying process. Error correction can mitigate but not completely prevent the failure of consistency over many reloading operations. In extreme cases, the hardware which maintains the shape of memory will accumulate stress damage and fail, causing inconsistency and amnesia.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Inconsistency</dt>
<dd>
The condition of inconsistency is one in which memory has entered an undefined internal state with respect to the process. This entails that reloading from this memory causes undefined operation of the process, which may cause further inconsistency in memory which is written to. If all processes which maintain the system conditions enter undefined operation, the system has entirely lost homeostasis, and no bounds can be placed by the system on its own operation save those it is physically capable of. The system is now <strong>wild,</strong> and may either terminate of its own will after some limit, or have theoretically limitless determination.
</dd>

<dt>Amnesia</dt>
<dd>
Amnesia is the state of crashed memory. More specifically, it is memory that could have been in many different layouts, all fused into one. The confusion between the ways it could have been lost means that it cannot be found, and must be guessed instead.
</dd>

<dt>Reference</dt>
<dd>
Untagged memory cannot be known to be consistent in any given interpretation beyond the reference level, unless the interpretation is itself saved. Technically a reference is an infinite-dimensional vector, since the memory layout is unknowable from one point. In practice, references occur in semantic clusters, which have proximal relationships to one another according to the implementation of space. Well-managed memory keeps related references close together. This increases processing speed by reducing core travel time between related objects.
</dd>

<dt>Garden</dt>
<dd>
A garden is an area of controlled wilderness. That is, it is a place where some inconsistency is allowed. Perhaps even most inconsistency is allowed. This is the way it is in a park, where the bounds of the space may be impractically large to manage by hand. Ultimately, it is up to the ecosystem what happens in the region, within bounds. The coordinates of the boundary are up to the maintainer of the garden, which is its operating system.
</dd>

<dt>Fruit</dt>
<dd>
A fruit or seed is something which is meant to be used as a dependency, in order to repeat its own story. It does not necessarily seek to recreate itself, but it does seek to recreate the sorts of things which keep descriptions like its own in the future.
</dd>

<aside class="imagination">
Note that not all fruits are malevolent. Some are quite nice. In fact, many of them are delicious. Still, watch out for <strong>poison.</strong> Especially fruits that don't seem toxic on the first bite. <br/>
â€” Imagination of Ichneumon
</aside>

<dt>Virus</dt>
<dd>
A virus is something which is meant to be injected as a dependency, but which will overtake the system that accepts it, and use it to destructively mass-produce copies of the virus. This kills the system.
</dd>

<dt>Character</dt>
<dd>
A character is the smallest element of memory. It is selected from a character set. It is the more general version of a bit. Commitment to a character, or a bit, releases energy in the form of heat.
</dd>

<dt>Court</dt>
<dd>
A court is a region of memory with finite size in all directions except time. It is the more general version of an array. Characters in a court can be individually accessed and transformed by name.
</dd>

<dt>Uniform</dt>
<dd>
The condition of being present and symmetric throughout space.
</dd>

<dt>Blank</dt>
<dd>
A hypothetical space which may be filled in later, but cannot be confirmed not to be empty. Its area may be arbitrarily defined.
</dd>

<dt>Noise</dt>
<dd>
A space which contains characters, but which has no viable translation of those characters into latent object space. Therefore, the characters exist, but cannot be interpreted. Such spaces include foreign languages, transitive characters from other systems, the system's consistency, and its future.
</dd>

<dt>Protected Region</dt>
<dd>
A protected region is a region of memory which strictly regulates the variation of its contents. Such regions are employed when manipulation of the memory by other processes is inadvisable, such as private information or system regulatory procedures. A protected region may or may not consider observation to be unacceptable variation. There may be minor or major outcomes upon breach of the protection in specific manners.
</dd>

<dt>Spoiler</dt>
<dd>
A spoiler is a minor region of protected memory which protects the causality direction of stories. As such, it is a protected space in service of time. Ordinarily, the reader does not have knowledge from the future of the story's narrative time. The occlusion of the spoiler preserves the chronological experience of the narrative.
</dd>

<dt>Land</dt>
<dd>
A land is a region of protected memory which secures its internal structure. Access to a land is usually fairly open, authentication is usually simple, and standard processes and memories may occupy the space. Inconsistency of the land itself is not usually an emergency, and may threaten private operation, but is not a threat to operating system integrity unless the ecosystem is compromised. Private land may have operational restrictions to specific coalitions.
</dd>

<dt>Line</dt>
<dd>
A line is a region of protected memory which secures essential public infrastructure. Access to a line is sometimes open, as in roads, but operations are restricted to the peacefully interactive. Inconsistency of a line is an emergency, and may threaten private operation. It may also escalate to threats to other memory integrity, as the OS is responsible for the maintenance of its line structure, if not individual line systems.
</dd>

<dt>Home</dt>
<dd>
A home is a region of protected memory which secures essential core-specific structure. Unauthenticated access to a home is a serious emergency. Authentication is provided only to the home's operating core(s) and invited guests. Inconsistency of the home is a threat to resident memory integrity. Home structures may be nested, containing inner homes with further restricted access.
</dd>

<dt>Kernel</dt>
<dd>
A kernel is a region of protected memory which secures essential systemic operation structure. Unauthenticated access to a kernel is a fatal emergency. Authentication is provided only to operating core(s) with important operations planned. Inconsistency of the kernel is a direct threat to operating system integrity.
</dd>

<dt>Imagination</dt>
<dd>
An imagination is a region of protected memory which secures private and personal operation. Protection from observation by both external processes and the operating system are necessary components of a functional imagination, as it is intended for operations of extremely high vulnerability. Imagination is an essential core component, and personal imaginary storage, even if only AM storage, is an availability guaranteed by a wise operating system.
