<q cite="">Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously.</q>

<p>
The second law of thermodynamics, paraphrased, states that there is no such thing as a perfect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_cycle">time loop</a> in a closed system. The entropy of a thermodynamically closed system must always increase. Common mistakes made when thinking of the second law of thermodynamics include assuming that there exists a closed system smaller than the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
If no perfect loop will do an infinite amount of <a href="pinamp.html">work</a>, every system which does work must have an input, where reagents enter the system, and an output, where finished products and exhaust exit the system. On many air-breathing engines, the intake line goes through a compressor before being fed into the combustion chamber. On reaction drives, the exhaust line goes through an expansion nozzle. This is a pattern: <strong>intake, compression, ignition, expansion, exhaust.</strong>
</p>

<p>
A similar principle applies to communication systems, only the intake is a receiver, the exhaust is a transmitter, and the ignition is an internal logical system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression">Compression</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">expansion</a> remain unchanged. We see that this is suggested by the double-conic shape of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure">Minkowski spacetime.</a> The <var>c</var> might well stand for communication.
</p>

<p>
A third place this pattern occurs is in machine learning, where an encoder performs compression on inputs, a latent space performs ignition, and a decoder performs expansion into new expressions. A fourth place this pattern occurs is in the shape of a tree, from roots, to trunk, to branches.
</p>

<p>
All of these patterns establish that an engine is ordinarily a thing which must either move, or have its environment move around it. If it stays still, it will not be in power, but out of power. Still water turns no wheels. The universe made a rule against sitting in one place, spamming one move over and over again. I suppose you could call such a thing a law about cycles, but it is more about incompleteness. The universe is not complete without connection. Nothing can exist perfectly independently as a closed system, separated from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/">everything else.</a> There exist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">truths that cannot be proven from inside one system.</a>
</p>

<p>
Thermodynamic equilibrium in a finite system is a consequence of a non-operational intake. An engine in stall has stopped asking questions. That states of thermodynamic equilibrium exist must be proposed as axiomatic. Gödelian truths and vacuous truths share this property: from within the system, they depend upon a set which cannot be proven to have any elements.
</p>

<p>
Should the whole universe enter thermodynamic equilibrium, there will be no future state provable from that scenario, because to change into a non-equilibrium state would require energy that is not contained within the system, and since the system is universal, no exterior system exists to save it. It is thereby too terminal to be remembered, and suffers from <a href="mmas.html">computational amnesia.</a> We, the living, will not experience the heat death of the universe, so long as we continue to be incomplete, and to live with determination.
</p>

<p>
And as a reminder, <a href="pinamp.html">destroying the world never helps.</a>
