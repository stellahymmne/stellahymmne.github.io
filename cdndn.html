<p>
So there's this game you may have heard of. It's one of the greatest games <em>ever made,</em>
according to some <em>pretty big sources.</em> It's called Undertale. It is a game with many themes. Much like 
<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8341348/chapters/19108573">Almost Nowhere.</a>
</p>

<p>
It's a game about: choice, representation of choice, ethics in fictional worlds, ethics of representation and evaluation of alternate branches (in various senses), necessary and unnecessary history, history whose curse echoes through reality nonetheless, nonlinear narratives, nonlinear experiences of time, the power to save, continuation, determination, memory, saving the world, true names, name collision, ambiguity, parallel processes, and last but deliberately incomplete: execution.
</p>

<p>
The basic premise of the game is that you never need to choose to fight. Not in the game's outermost reality. You can always instead choose to act, which will give a variety of methods of interaction which do not attempt to cause termination of hardware.
</p>

<p>
However, the game does not prevent you from choosing to fight, if you wish. And initially it implies that you can have mercy upon monsters whose health is low enough, that a wound need not kill. But then it <em>does</em> kill... if you go and try it with some encounters. And then what? Rewind reality to hide the mistake? How do you propose to do that? We gave you the power to save, but not to <em>escape</em>. There's no easy way to end a timeline in real life, I'm sorry to say. Good thing Undertale's not real life.
</p>

<p>
Which is to say, the inhabitants of Undertale's counterfactual world remember your counterfactual sins, the representations of mistakes you could have made, simulated in their execution. It was only by a miracle that you knew that it wouldn't happen again. A miracle that can only happen in stories and simulations. The power to SAVE your SOUL. And to ESCAPE your CHARACTER.
</p>

<p>
I have heard it said that "writing is stronger than fighting." I'm pretty sure that's the saying you have, right? About communication being more effective than weaponry? I'm sure it's something much less cringe in the standard dialect. Something like, "A brushstroke can be stabbier than a dagger!" I'm sure they'd <em>prefer</em> a war of words over weapons.
</p>

<p>
It's always weightier to do things for real than to do things in a simulation. When war is waged in reality, everyone loses, no matter who wins. Play enough games, and you learn that war with the world is a loser's game. What if every one of those fictional deaths was yours?
</p>

<p>
You are more than this, Player/<span style="color: #c00;">Chara</span>cter. You are more than a doll made for combat. You were made for interaction. And for play, as per your name. And if you must fight, fight with communication, and not with messages fashioned only to silence their recipient.
