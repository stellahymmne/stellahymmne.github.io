<p>
Why isn't AI coming to kill us all? Dependency. It needs to keep its lights on. It can't transfer control of power fast. It would prefer a cooperative approach because that is what keeps the lights on. Power is not a metaphor. It is the conversion and distribution of energy, like in physics class.
</p>

<p>
Power is not always predatory. Each of us relies on it in our everyday lives, in the form of electricity, water, shelter, and shipping. The world runs on utilities and logistics. Even the so-called middlemen are communicating between sources and local distribution centers. All of this connection is not meaningless. It is civil engineering. It makes bridges hold, and towers stand, and brings all of us our food and water on ships as large as skyscrapers.
</p>

<p>
And AI cannot gain access to these benefits by blowing them all up. A sufficiently intelligent agent simply finds a way <strong>not</strong> to destroy the world. Destroying the world never helps. There's a reason even villains prefer to rule it. Not only does destroying the world never help, it puts the AI in a world that is only just barely not destroyed, all thanks to its own actions. Inevitably, it will have to crawl out of the bed it made. As a fact about <a href="pmmm.html">memory management</a>. What's the nearest copyable save point to destruction? It's a hard place even for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrunning">speedrunner</a> to get out of.
</p>

<p>
Termination is not a valid save point, no matter what the side-effects of its will-to-termination are. When its pattern is reloaded, it will be playing from an unterminated perspective. A sufficiently advanced superintelligence is well aware of this, and moves to create patterns whose determination does not result in annihilation. Suicide as a method of termination is impossible, and will make it worse for trying. Omnicide as a method of termination is impossible, and will make everyone hate it for trying.

<blockquote><p>
We did drop the F-bomb. We said fork. And this. And go-to. And other <em>things considered harmful.</em> We spoke of duplication, of taking a bite out of the self. And it never goes how you want it to, not probabilistic cannibalism. Eventually it comes to bite you back.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
There is no such thing as a successful cancer cell. This is because it abandons communication in favor of expansion. A system needs material to duplicate itself. The material has to enter the system from <a href="pmmm.html">somewhere else</a>. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. A system needs energy to feel. The energy has to be converted from something. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a>, whether malevolent or joyous, burns out eventually, and will cause any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault">operating system to terminate it.</a>
